# Todo

- Figure out how to integrate API/web-app into same codebase. (or through Docker somehow).
- Move edgeApi to fastapi, enable documentation.
- Move edge-inference scripts here.
- Add inference dependencies to the package.
- Support for pipelines: TODO
- Add support for [docsqa.jina.ai](https://docsqa.jina.ai/) after documentation is complete. This would provide an automated bot for the end-user.
- Work through these items for the PyPi package improvement ([link](libraries.io/pypi/visionai/sourcerank)):
