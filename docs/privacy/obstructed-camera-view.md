## Overview

The obstructed camera detection model uses computer vision techniques to analyze the camera's video feed and identify if there is any obstruction present in the camera's field of view. The model utilizes deep learning techniques to learn the features of an unobstructed camera view and detects the presence of obstructions by analyzing the changes in the image features.

The obstructed camera detection model can operate in real-time, providing continuous monitoring of the camera's field of view. This model can detect various types of obstructions, including partial obstructions, and can provide an alert when an obstruction is detected.


## Vision AI based monitoring

The aim of an obstructed camera detection model is to detect whether a cameras field of view is obstructed or not. This model is designed to detect various types of obstructions such as fingers, tape, post-it notes, or other physical objects that might block the camera view. The obstructed camera detection model can be useful in different settings such as surveillance systems, video conferencing, or any other applications that require a clear and unobstructed camera view.

In summary, the obstructed camera detection model is a computer vision-based algorithm that uses deep learning techniques to detect obstructions in a camera's field of view. This model can be useful in various settings, providing real-time monitoring of camera views and alerting when obstructions are present.

## Model Details

### Dataset

The dataset consists of images and videos collected from various sources. 

### Model
The model to detect obstructed camera event is in progress and it will be released soon. 

### Scenario details

The business logic for this scenario is as follows:

- We use existing camera feeds from the premises to monitor whether the camera view is obstructed or not. We detect partial obstructions that may only partially block the camera view, such as fingers partially covering the lens. 

- VisionAI system is able to run on edge devices. It uses camera feeds for processing.

- When an instance of obstructed camera is detected, an alert will be raised.

=== "Test now with online Web-Cam"
     To test this model & scenario, you can use the following steps:

     - Install the visionai package from PyPI
     
        ```console
        $ pip install visionai
        
        ```
     
     - Test the scenario from your local web-cam
     

        ```console
        $ visionai scenario test obstructed-camera-detection

        Downloading models for scenario: obstructed-camera-detection
        Model: obstructed-camera-detection: https://workplaceos.blob.core.windows.net/models/yolov5s-obstructed-camera-detection/yolov5s-obstructed-camera-detection-0.0.1.zip
        

        Starting scenario: obstructed-camera-detection..

        ```
    - You should be able to see the events generated on your console window with the detections of obstructed cameras.

=== "With RTSP Camera - Pipelines"
     [TODO]
 
=== "With Azure Setup"
     VisionAI app is available at a Azure Market place, one can download and use it by following steps mentioned [here](../overview/azure-managed-app.md)
