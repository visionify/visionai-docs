## Important Safety Notice

> **VisionAI's fire detection system is designed to complement, not replace, your primary fire detection infrastructure.** While our AI system achieves ~90% accuracy in early detection, it should be used alongside traditional fire alarm systems, smoke detectors, and established safety protocols.

### Complementary Detection System
- Works alongside traditional fire alarms
- Provides visual verification capability
- Adds an extra layer of safety
- Helps reduce false alarm costs

### System Performance
- ~90% detection accuracy
- Early visual warning system
- Real-time monitoring capability
- Integration with existing safety systems

### Recommended Usage

- ✓ Secondary monitoring system
- ✓ Visual verification tool
- ✓ Early warning capability
- ✗ Not a replacement for fire alarms
- ✗ Not a primary life safety system

## The Business Impact of Fire Incidents

Fire incidents create devastating impacts on businesses:

- **$15 billion** annual fire damage costs in U.S. industrial facilities
- **3,000** workplace fires per year in manufacturing alone
- **70%** of businesses fail within 3 years of a major fire
- Average downtime of **3-4 months** after significant fire damage

## Beyond Traditional Fire Detection

While conventional systems wait for heat or smoke to reach sensors, VisionAI detects the earliest signs of fire:

### 1. Earlier Detection
- Spot smoke and fire in **30 seconds** where as traditional systems take around **6 minutes**
- Audio / Speaker based alerting
- Instant Text Message alerts with video verification
- Reduce response time dramatically

### 2. Comprehensive Coverage
- Monitor high-risk areas 24/7
- Cover large spaces effectively
- Detect fires in hard-to-reach areas
- Works in all lighting conditions

### 3. Reduced False Alarms
- AI-powered verification
- Visual confirmation of threats
- Distinguish between steam and smoke
- Minimize costly evacuations
