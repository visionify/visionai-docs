## Overview

Working at heights poses significant risks, including serious injuries or fatalities. Vision AI offers a robust solution to enhance workplace safety by preventing falls and ensuring compliance with safety regulations. Our system provides real-time monitoring and alerts, enabling timely interventions and reducing the risk of accidents.

- **Harness usage**: Is the person wearing a harness if above a restricted height.
- **No Safety Shoes**: Is the person not wearing safety shoes.
- **No Helmet**: Is the person not wearing a helmet.
- **No Fall Arrest System**: Is the person not wearing a fall arrest system.

## Key Benefits

- **24x7 Monitoring**: Utilize existing camera feeds to continuously monitor work environments for potential incidents.
- **Real-time Alerts**: Enable real-time alerts through Text, Mobile App notification when an incident is observed. 
- **High Accuracy**: Our AI model is trained on diverse real-world scenarios, minimizing them robust and reducing false positives.
- **Compliance Increase**: Our solution is able to increase compliance by 85% at the workplace.
