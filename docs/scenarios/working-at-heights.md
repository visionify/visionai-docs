Working at heights is a hazardous activity and has the potential to cause serious injuries or fatalities. It is important for employers to ensure that the work place is set up to prevent employees from falling off of elevated surfaces. Employers must provide proper training and equipment to employees who work at heights and must ensure that safety regulations are followed. Employers should also provide periodic reviews to ensure that employees are following safety protocols and that the work environment is safe and secure.

Working at heights, such as on a roof or in a tall building, requires specialized safety equipment and training to ensure the safety of the workers. Depending on the job, you may need to wear a safety harness or other protective gear.

Falling from heights is a serious hazard, and can result in serious injury or even death. Timely action in the event of a Fall/Slip accident can minimize damage and save lives.



## Vision AI based monitoring 

Vision AI-based system can be used to detect slip and fall with high accuracy. Additionally, our model trained on real-world images minimizes false-positives or false-negatives.  

The cameras scan every frame to ensure there are no accidents related to slip and fall cases. 

To ensure accuracy and reliability for the model, these camera-based monitoring services should be supplemented by strong compliance processes. Furthermore, workers working in different factory units should always be made aware of these accidents and how to safeguard them. 

## Model Details 

### Dataset 

Model training is carried out with Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context dataset. Only person class is considered for model building. COCO is a  large-scale dataset that addresses three core research problems in scene understanding: detecting non-iconic views (or non-canonical perspectives of objects), contextual reasoning between objects and the precise 2D localization of objects. 

COCO dataset has an even distribution of: 

- Different(indoor/outdoor) environments 

- Male vs Female  

- Different light settings 

- Variations in camera orientations 

- Using security camera feeds 

### Model 

The model is built using Yolov5 pre-trained model for detecting a person followed by a media pipe library used to estimate the pose of the person.

            <td>71.0% </td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>

The model is adaptable enough to run on any edge computing device.


### Scenario details


The business logic for this scenario is as follows: 

- We use existing camera feeds from the premises to monitor and detect occurrences of slip and fall incidents. 

- VisionAI s able to run on edge devices. It uses camera feeds for processing. 

- We detect human poses to identify slip and fall accidents in the camera feed.  
- If either slip or fall is detected, an alert is raised.
