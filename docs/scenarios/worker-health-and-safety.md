# Worker Health and Safety

Workplace injuries are a growing concern for employers and employees. In 2021, the US recorded 5,190 fatal work injuries, with the private sector alone reporting 2.6 million non-fatal injuries. These numbers highlight the need for companies to prioritize workplace safety and implement measures to prevent injuries. Unsafe workplace environments not only result in injuries and fatalities but also account for downtime, reduced productivity, increased healthcare costs, and legal fines.

Despite advancements in safety equipment and protective gear, injuries still occur due to non-compliance with protocols and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). Therefore, employers are responsible for providing up-to-date safety gear and equipment and ensuring their correct usage and compliance. This should involve live monitoring and enforcing adherence to established protocols and SOPs. By taking these measures, employers can effectively mitigate workplace hazards and prevent injuries from occurring.

Establishing protocols and guidelines and providing safety gear might not seem difficult, but ensuring that every individual is consistently complying is challenging. A lapse in compliance and usage of protective equipment (PPE), even for a short duration, can result in a workplace accident. Therefore, you need a mechanism to ensure everyone complies and adheres to guidelines. But the question is, how do you do it?
