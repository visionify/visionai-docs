# Occupancy Policies

Ensuring security and controlled access at the workplace is vital for organizations, but conventional surveillance and crowd management techniques are complex, expensive, and heavily reliant on human intervention. Furthermore, these systems are often unable to provide desired, foolproof results due to limitations, inaccuracies, and the inability to provide multiple metrics. One of the significant challenges with current systems for workplace crowd management is the constantly evolving workplace dynamics.

 Whatâ€™s included under Occupancy policies:

- Max occupancy
- Restricted areas/times
- Dwell time

## Overview

Measuring occupancy metrics is crucial for businesses because of the valuable insights it offers. By accurately measuring and analyzing occupancy metrics, businesses can make data-driven decisions to improve other aspects of their business, like optimizing the physical layout and resource management.

## Vision AI based monitoring

Track workplace Occupancy Metrics effortlessly with Vision AI monitoring ready-to-deploy model that provides real-time insights and analysis with valuable insights such as:

- Occupancy count: This measures the number of people or objects within a given space, such as a room or a parking lot.

- Dwell time: This measures the amount of time that people spend in a particular location, such as a store or a workspace.

- Occupancy behavior: This tracks how people move and interact within a space, providing insights into how spaces are being used and how they can be optimized.

- Occupancy trends: This analyzes occupancy data over time, identifying patterns and trends that can inform business decisions such as staffing, marketing, and capacity planning.

- Occupancy alerts: This triggers alerts when occupancy levels exceed predetermined thresholds, enabling businesses to take proactive measures to manage crowds and ensure safety.

# **Restricted areas/times**

> Secure restricted areas with our powerful AI-based monitoring system that detects and prevents unauthorized access in real-time

# Overview
Unauthorized access to restricted zones at the workplace can lead to theft, accidents, and other security breaches. Be it valuable assets, sensitive information or providing employee safety, maintaining high-security and controlled access for restricted zones at the workplace is essential for all organizations. 

Another major problem with existing systems cannot detect intrusion after an unauthorized access has been made.This renders biometric, sensors and security personnels ineffective after an unauthorized access has been already made.



## Vision AI based monitoring

With our Vision AI monitoring you can authorize access as well as continuous monitor live feeds inside a restricted area for real-time detection of unauthorized personnel. Our fully automated detection models are not only more powerful and accurate than existing systems but also more affordable and easy to integrate into existing infrastructure allowing users to scale the power of i-based real-time detection with a few simple clicks.

  <figcaption>Detection of unauthorized entry event</figcaption>
</figure>

## Events

VisionAI model's generated events would be:

- Person detected in restricted area
- Movement detected in restricted area
- Person detected after hours
- Movement detected after hours"

It is recommended that any instance of unauthorized entry be reported to the appropriate authority.
An event data for a unauthozrized entry in exclusion zones may include information such as:

- Date and time of the event
- Location of the event
- Image of the event


## Model Details

### Dataset

The dataset consists of images and videos collected from diverse sources and is designed to reflect real-world scenarios. It is evenly distributed with:


- *Different environments*: Both indoor and outdoor with varying/contrasting surrounding and infrastructure details

- *Different angles and perspectives*: The dataset includes images captured from different angles and perspectives, such as from above, below, or from the side of subjects

- *Different modes of unauthorized access*: The dataset includes images of individuals attempting to gain unauthorized access in different ways, such as climbing over fences, breaking locks, using counterfeit credentials, or attempting to sneak past security personnel.

- *Diversity of individuals*: The dataset includes images of individuals from different genders, ages, and ethnicities, to ensure that the AI model is able to accurately detect unauthorized access attempts regardless of the individual's appearance.

### Scenario details

Real-time detection and alerts for different kinds unauthorized access which includes but are not limited to:

- When an unauthorized person follows an authorized person through a secure area without proper authorization
- When an individual lingering around restricted areas without proper authorization
- Forceful entry 
- Use of counterfeit access credentials
- Unauthorized access attempts during off-hours
