Our enterprise solution helps you:

- Ensure worker safety in high-risk zones
- Monitor pedestrian and vehicle pathways
- Track occupancy limits in restricted areas
- Generate compliance documentation automatically

## Why Area Control Matters for Workplace Safety

In today's complex industrial environments, maintaining worker safety in different areas of your facility is a critical challenge for EHS managers. Whether it's:

- Protecting workers from dangerous equipment zones
- Managing occupancy in high-risk areas
- Ensuring compliance with safety regulations
- Preventing unauthorized access to restricted areas
- Maintaining clear emergency exit paths

Traditional safety methods like physical barriers, warning signs, or periodic safety walks have significant gaps:

- No real-time monitoring capability
- Heavy reliance on worker compliance
- Limited coverage of large facilities
- Difficulty in proving compliance
- No data for safety improvements
- High cost of dedicated safety personnel
