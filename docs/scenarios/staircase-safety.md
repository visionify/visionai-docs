Visionify's Staircase Safety Suite focuses on preventing accidents and injuries in one of the most common yet hazardous areas of any facility - staircases. This suite monitors various unsafe behaviors including failure to use handrails, running on stairs, using mobile phones while climbing/descending, and skipping steps. These behaviors are leading causes of workplace accidents, often resulting in serious injuries.

By identifying these risky behaviors in real-time, organizations can take proactive measures to prevent staircase-related incidents. The suite helps safety managers enforce proper staircase usage protocols and create awareness about safe staircase practices among employees.
