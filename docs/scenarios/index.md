# Scenarios

Scenarios form the building blocks of VisionAI platform. These scenarios are organized into `Suites`. Below we talk about different suites and the scenarios that are part of them.

- All scenarios are available as pick-n-choose scenarios. You can pick the scenarios you want based on your business needs. Each scenario is independently tested.
- Events provided by these scenarios are given below. Events are sent to Redis & Azure EventHub pubsub systems for further integration.
- There are a few common events supported by all scenarios (daily summary, weekly summary etc.)
- Currently supported scenarios are highlighted by a âœ…. Roadmap scenarios are highlighted by a ðŸ“….
- Each of the scenarios can be quickly tested through `visionai run <scenario-name>` command. For example:

``` bash
visionai run smoke-and-fire-detection
```

!!! note "New scenario request"
    This section lists down all the scenarios that are supported by the VisionAI platform. There are more scenarios added daily - please [send a request](https://github.com/visionify/visionai/issues/new) to us about any additional scenarios you need.

## Privacy Suite

For a majority of organizations - employee privacy is a top concern. Along with employee privacy, the organization needs to make sure that any data does not leave the premises. Any faces detected through Vision AI system need to be blurred, along with text, signage, computer screens and other sensitive information.

Before any other scenarios are run, or before we store or process the images - the images are pre-processed through this privacy suite. As such, privacy suite is treated differently from other scenarios. Below examples provide a high-level overview of the privacy suite.

## Worker Health & Safety Suite

Following scenarios provide Worker Health and Safety examples supported by VisionAI suite. (Also referred to as Personnel Health and Safety).

Workplace Personnel Health & Safety is important because it ensures that employees are safe and healthy in their work environment. This includes providing a safe and healthy work environment, proper safety training, and regular safety inspections. Additionally, it also includes enforcing safety policies to ensure that all employees are aware of and follow safety procedures, as well as encouraging a culture of safety within the workplace.

Currently supported scenarios are highlighted by a âœ…. 

You can see real-time events generated as soon as person is detected without PPE (helmets, gloves, safety boots etc.). There are options to configure what PPE's are required for your scenario. This can be done through the VisionAI web-application which can be accessed on through http://localhost:3001.

| Status | Scenario name | Supported Events | Additional considerations |
| :----: | :------------ | :--------------- | :------------------------ |
| âœ… | `ppe-detection` | `Person detected without helmet` <br> `Person detected without gloves` <br> `Person detected without safety boots` <br> `Person detected without safety goggles` <br> `Person detected without face mask` <br> `Person detected without vest` <br> `Person detected without full-body suit` <br> `Person detected without PFAS` <br> `Person detected without ear protection` | [More details](ppe-detection.md){:target="_blank"}

## Occupancy Policies

Occupancy Policies relate to counting and tracking employees and/or other personnel in the room. These could include people-counting and enforcing max-occupancy policies, or tracking people's dwell time in a confined space.

Currently supported scenarios are highlighted by a âœ…. 

!!! note "Occupancy Metrics"
    - Occupancy metrics is similar in structure to max-occupancy, or restricted areas scenarios.
    - However it sends out a summary event is structured like this. This will give a granular summary event at the end of the day.
    - Users can start with occupancy-metrics and then move to max-occupancy or restricted areas if they need to enforce policies.
    ``` json
    {
      "date": "2023-02-23",
      "stations": [{
        "id": "station_1",
        "hours": [
            {
              "start_time": "2023-02-23T14:00:01",
              "end_time": "2023-02-23T15:00:00",
              "occupancy_cnt": 14
            }
            ...
        ]
      }...]
    }
    ```

Also need to specify that the camera needs to be configured to have a good view of the stations where occupancy metrics need to be checked.

| Status | Scenario name | Supported Events | Additional considerations |
| :----: | :------------ | :--------------- | :------------------------ |
| âœ… | `max-occupancy`              | `Person count exceeds max limit` | [More details](max-occupancy-count.md) |
| âœ… | `restricted-areas`           | `Person detected in restricted area` <br> `Movement detected in restricted area` <br> `Person detected after hours` <br> `Movement detected after hours` | [More details](exclusion-zones.md){:target="_blank"} |
| âœ… | `dwell-time`                 | `Person detected` <br> `Person left` <br> `Person dwell time exceeds limit` <br> `Person detected without motion` <br> `Person fall detected` | [More details](confined-spaces-monitoring.md){:target="_blank"} |
| âœ… | `station-occupancy`          | `Daily summary event` | [More details](station-occupancy.md){:target="_blank"} |
| ðŸ“… | `occupancy-metrics`          | `Daily summary event` |
| ðŸ“… | `authorized-personnel-only`  | `Unauthorized person detected` |



[^1]: This works by detecting a person's uniform and comparing it to a list of authorized personnel. This is a more advanced scenario and requires a custom model to be trained for your specific use-case.

## Company Policies

Company policies include specific scenarios that are relevant to your company. These could include scenarios like no-smoking/no-vaping zones, no food or drinks in certain areas, or no cell phones/pictures in certain areas. Some of these scenarios overlap with [occupancy policies](#occupancy-policies), but they are still useful to have here as separate scenarios.

| Status | Scenario name | Supported Events | Additional considerations |
| :----: | :------------ | :--------------- | :------------------------ |
| ðŸ“… | `no-food-or-drinks-allowed`  | `Person with food detected` <br> `Person with drinks detected` <br> `Spill event detected` | [More details](no-food-or-drinks.md){:target="_blank"} |
| âœ… | `no-phone-text-pictures`     | `Cellphone usage detected` <br> `Person detected taking pictures` | [More details](no-phone-usage.md){:target="_blank"} |
| âœ… | `no-smoking-or-vaping`       | `Smoking event detected` <br> `Vaping event detected` | [More details](no-smoking.md){:target="_blank"} |

## Suspicious Activity detection

Suspicious activity detection suite relies on a combination of activity detection models and object detection models. These models are trained to detect suspicious activity in a variety of scenarios.

## Next Steps

Now that you have a better understanding of the scenarios that are available, you can start to think about how you can organize these scenarios into a solution that meets your needs. You can also go to the individual scenario page to learn more about it. We can customize each of these models for your use-cases and provide you with a solution that is tailored to your needs.
