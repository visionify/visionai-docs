# Scenarios

Scenarios (also referred to as `use cases`) form the building blocks of VisionAI platform. These scenarios are organized into `Suites`. Below we talk about different suites and the scenarios that are part of them.

- All scenarios are available as pick-n-choose scenarios. You can pick the scenarios you want based on your business needs. Each scenario is independently tested.
- Some scenarios require zones to be defined - you can define zones through the VisionAI web-application.
- Events provided by these scenarios are given below. Events are sent to Redis, MQTT & WebSocket endpoints for custom integrations.
- Currently supported scenarios are highlighted by a âœ…. Roadmap scenarios are highlighted by a ðŸ“….

Below image also provides a summary of all the scenarios that are supported by VisionAI.

!!! note "New scenario request"
    This chapter lists down all the scenarios that are supported by the VisionAI platform. We are always looking to expand our suite - please [send a request](https://support.visionify.ai) to us about any additional scenarios you need.

## PPE Compliance

PPE Compliance is our core application. We support most of the common types of PPEs used in manufacturing & construction industry. This suite is sometimes also referred to by `Worker Health and Safety`.

PPE compliance is the first step towards a comprehensive safety program. Workers sometimes forget to wear PPEs like helmets, gloves, safety boots, high-vis vests, goggles, masks, coveralls etc., due to lack of awareness or complacency. PPE Compliance helps you ensure that workers are wearing the required PPEs.

Ensuring PPE Compliance can yield significant benefits. It can help reduce the number of accidents and injuries in the workplace, improve productivity, and enhance the overall safety culture of the organization.

## Area Controls

Area controls is a core scenario of the VisionAI application. With this scenario - we can enable different area and time related use-cases. Area control scenarios require a zone to be configured for each of the different events.

For example, if we want to setup a Pedestrian Pathway, or create a Man-Machine area that is restricted during certain hours - we can do that with area control scenarios.

Deploying Area Control scenarios requires understanding of the camera area and the type of work performed there. We recommend that you look at the video clips from the camera, and tune the scenario accordingly.

## Forklift Safety

Visionify's Forklift Safety suite detects near-misses between forklifts & people, forklift-speed limit, and dedicated pathways for forklifts & people. This scenario is useful for areas where forklifts are operated.

Forklift Safety also implements other best practices like Wearning Seatbelts, Stop sign compliance etc.

Our forklift safety suite can be considered as a passive safety system. It does not actively prevent any accidents, but it does help you identify areas that need attention. The goal of the Forklift Safety Suite is to make your team aware of the risks, so you can data driven changes to make your workplace safer.

## Emergency Events

Emergency events detection is critical for workplace safety. This suite focuses on detecting various emergency situations that require immediate attention, such as smoke, fire, slip, trip and falls, any person-down events resulting from exhaustion and heat-stroke. Early detection of these events can help prevent accidents and enable quick response times.

!!! note "Alert Notifications"
    Visionify's system can be configured to send out an alert when any of these emergency events are detected. This alert can be sent as a Text Message, Email or a notification through Microsoft Teams.

## Heatmaps and Occupancy Metrics

Occupancy metrics suite provides use-cases for person counting, heatmaps (density maps) of people & forklifts, desk occupancy, station occupancy and mobile phone usage metrics. 

Visionify's occupancy metrics suite can be used with the rest of our suite to enable different compliance policies or collect general planning data for your organization.

## Housekeeping

Visionify's Housekeeping Suite provides various hazard identifications on the work floor. These metrics include identifying spills and leaks on the floor, unattended objects, boxes or pallets on the floor, identifying door open/close events, blocked exits monitoring, missing fire-extinguishers etc. 

Housekeeping suite provides organization a second set of eyes for their regular audits. By identifying hazards early, this suite tends to avoid accidents and injuries.

## Behavioral Safety Suite

Visionify's Behavioral Safety Suite focuses on identifying and correcting unsafe behaviors before they lead to accidents. This suite monitors various behavioral patterns including running in work areas, climbing on equipment or railings, smoking/vaping in prohibited areas, consuming food/drinks in restricted zones, and mobile phone usage in unsafe conditions. 

By detecting these unsafe behaviors early, organizations can provide timely interventions and training to promote safer work practices. The Behavioral Safety suite serves as a proactive tool for safety managers to reinforce safety protocols and maintain workplace discipline.

## Staircase Safety

Visionify's Staircase Safety Suite focuses on preventing accidents and injuries in one of the most common yet hazardous areas of any facility - staircases. This suite monitors various unsafe behaviors including failure to use handrails, running on stairs, using mobile phones while climbing/descending, and skipping steps. These behaviors are leading causes of workplace accidents, often resulting in serious injuries.

By identifying these risky behaviors in real-time, organizations can take proactive measures to prevent staircase-related incidents. The suite helps safety managers enforce proper staircase usage protocols and create awareness about safe staircase practices among employees.

## Employee Privacy (Face Blurring)

For a majority of organizations - employee privacy is a top concern. Along with employee privacy, the organization needs to make sure that any data does not leave the premises. Any faces detected through Vision AI system need to be blurred, along with text, signage, computer screens and other sensitive information.

Before any other scenarios are run, or before we store or process the images - the images are pre-processed through this privacy suite. As such, privacy suite is treated differently from other scenarios. Below examples provide a high-level overview of the privacy suite.


**Table: Privacy Suite Events and Detection Details**

| Status | Scenario name | Details | Details |
| :----: | :------------ | :--------------- | :------------------------ |
| âœ… | `face-blurring` | Blur any faces detected | [More details](../reference/privacy.md){:target="_blank"} |
| âœ… | `text-blurring` | Blue any text detected (paper, computer screens etc) | |
| âœ… | `license-plate-blurring` | Blur any license plates detected | |
| ðŸ“… | `signs-blurring` | Blur any signs detected | |
| ðŸ“… | `obstructed-camera` | If camera feed is obstructed, send an alert |  |

## Company Policies

Company policies include specific scenarios that are relevant to your company. These could include scenarios like no-smoking/no-vaping zones, no food or drinks in certain areas, or no cell phones/pictures in certain areas. Some of these scenarios overlap with [occupancy metrics](#heatmaps-and-occupancy-metrics), but they are still useful to have here as separate scenarios.

**Table: Company Policies Events and Detection Details**

| Status | Scenario name | Supported Events | Details |
| :----: | :------------ | :--------------- | :------------------------ |
