## The Cost of Forklift Accidents

Forklift incidents create significant impact on businesses:

- **70 fatalities** and **34,900 serious injuries** annually from forklift accidents
- **$135,000** average cost per forklift accident
- **$38,000** in indirect costs per lost workday injury
- **30%** of forklift accidents involve pedestrians

## Important Safety Notice

> **VisionAI's forklift safety system is a passive monitoring solution designed to complement your existing safety protocols.** While our system helps identify risks and prevent accidents, it should be used alongside traditional safety measures, training, and established protocols.

## Supported Safety Events

Visionify's Forklift Safety suite detects near-misses between forklifts & people, forklift-speed limit, and dedicated pathways for forklifts & people. This scenario is useful for areas where forklifts are operated.

Forklift Safety also implements other best practices like Wearning Seatbelts, Stop sign compliance etc.

Our forklift safety suite can be considered as a passive safety system. It does not actively prevent any accidents, but it does help you identify areas that need attention. The goal of the Forklift Safety Suite is to make your team aware of the risks, so you can data driven changes to make your workplace safer.
