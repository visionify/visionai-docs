# Occupancies Policies

Ensuring security and controlled access at the workplace is vital for organizations, but conventional surveillance and crowd management techniques are complex, expensive, and heavily reliant on human intervention. Furthermore, these systems are often unable to provide desired, foolproof results due to limitations, inaccuracies, and the inability to provide multiple metrics.

One of the significant challenges with current systems for workplace crowd management is the constantly evolving workplace dynamics. For instance, frequent changes in access requirements can make it difficult to reconfigure one-time installation measures and create a tedious and time-consuming task. As a result, these systems may be limited in terms of flexibility, adaptability, and scalability, making them less effective in certain situations and unable to adapt to changing needs or circumstances. This challenge highlights the need for more dynamic and adaptable solutions to accommodate the evolving nature of workplaces.
