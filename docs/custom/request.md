We use the ease of a single web console to conveniently monitor your whole work place. We assist you in avoiding problems before they affect or are noticed by users. Using our monitoring service, learn more about:

    1. Event logs
    2. Root Cause Analysis
    3. Traffic monitoring

- *Alerts*:
Quick alerts and notifications for events (eg. accidents/non-compliance) can be send through emails/messages.


- *Reporting*:
Detailed reports can be generated for daily/monthly basis. Frequency of reports can be customized to accomodate user preferences.
